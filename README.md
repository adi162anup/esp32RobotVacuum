# esp32RobotVacuum
A simple prototype of an esp32 microcontroller based robot vacuum operated via a mobile application through bluetooth.

# Based On:
* Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather Board
* Sparkfun TB6612 Motor Driver
* Songle 5V Dual Channel Relay Module with Optocoupler

# Components:
* 11.1 V LI-PO Battery as power source for motors as well as vacuum fans
* Power Bank used as 5V input supply(V<sub>in</sub>) to power the esp32.
* 2x 300 RPM BO Motors along with wheels
* 2x 12 V Brushless DC Cooling Blade Fan
* 3x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
